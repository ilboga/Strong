# Strong Authentication Package

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silentworks/Strong.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silentworks/Strong)

## Changes
- pdo driver needs pdo object instead of a connection string
- namespaces
- hashPassword method available directly from Strong class instead of calling getProvider method first
- password hash is now using [password_compat](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat) dependency
- providers can now be class instance rather than just a string
